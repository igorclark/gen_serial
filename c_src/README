UNIX Native Code
----------------

The code is POSIX compatible so it should compile without too much
hassle on a number of UNIX-like platforms besides Linux where it has been
developed and tested. Comments/patches welcome if you manage to do so.

There is a Makefile in the posix/ subdirectory, so assuming you have a
reasonably sane UNIX development environment (make, cc, etc.) you
should be able to simply issue 'make' and obtain the serial_esock
executable. This executable will be copied to the priv/bin directory
automatically.

Note: it is expected that compiling programs from source does not pose
significant inconveniences to anyone. For this reason, and the fact
that distributing executable binaries is not a generally feasible
approach on UNIX platforms, a pre-built binary is NOT distributed.
